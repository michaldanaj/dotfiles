## Caching

# clean removes all cache entries from the cache directory, 
# clearing it out entirely.
uv cache

# removes all cache entries for the ruff package, useful for 
# invalidating the cache for a single or finite set of packages.
uv cache clean ruff

# removes all unused cache entries. For example, the cache 
# directory may contain entries created in previous uv versions 
# that are no longer necessary and can be safely removed. uv cache 
# prune is safe to run periodically, to keep the cache directory clean.
uv cache prune
